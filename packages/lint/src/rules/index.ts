/**
 * Every rule, in the order findings are reported. A new rule is one more entry here; `agent`
 * on the rule decides whether it is also in the set returned after every write.
 *
 * The agent's set is L01 to L07, L13 and L16. L08 to L12, L14, L15 and L17, and what L03 to L05
 * see inside a chart, are for the user's design check alone (WG7-T07): each finding that goes
 * back to the agent costs tokens and rounds of the quality gate, and whether any of these is
 * worth that is the user's decision.
