/**
 * A template from layouts that were drawn as slides (WG7-T11a, THM-06). Whoever designs a
 * template, a person or the agent, draws each layout as a slide and marks what a deck fills in
 * with a role. Here that slide becomes a layout: the elements that carry a role are its
 * placeholders, what they were drawn with is the layout's sample, and everything else is its
 * decorations. Two roles mark what the layout draws on every slide and no deck fills in, the
 * master components: the logo, and the slide's number. They stay decorations, with their role.
 *
 * Pure, like the rest of the engine: slides in, a template out. Where the slides come from (the
 * HTML conversion) and where the template goes (a preview, the library) is the app's.
