 * - The theme is replaced, so everything that uses tokens follows.
 * - What a slide holds of the old theme as a copy follows too (see `followTheme`): a colour of
 *   the theme inside a CSS fill, the theme's corner radius, the theme's shadow.
 * - The deck gets the template's layouts for its direction, in the template's order.
 * - Each slide moves to the layout `matchLayout` finds for it, and its elements follow their
 *   placeholders there (see `followPatch`). Nothing is deleted: an element whose role has no
 *   placeholder in the new layout stays where it is.
 * - A slide whose archetype the template does not have keeps its layout, which stays in the deck
 *   after the template's own and follows the new theme through its tokens.
 * - A slide without a layout takes the layout of its archetype when that layout has a place for
 *   everything on it (see `adoptLayout`); otherwise it only follows the theme.
 *
 * Switching back gives the deck back, for everything that followed the template.
